                <h2>From Coursework to Commitment</h2>
                <h3>Week 4 Journal Entry</h3>
                <p class="date">January 29, 2026</p>
                
                <p>This week represented a clear shift in my IS490 senior project—from steady coursework into firm commitment toward certification. The structure and pacing I put in place earlier in the quarter are now being fully exercised, and the results are measurable.</p>
                
                <p>I completed Udemy Sections 3 and 4, which covered project management fundamentals and the PMBOK® 7 performance domains. Much of this material reinforced concepts I have already encountered in PM350, PM450, and throughout my professional IT experience. However, working through it in a CAPM-specific context made it clear how PMI frames these concepts for examination purposes. The emphasis on terminology, definitions, and structured thinking is very deliberate and reinforces the importance of aligning knowledge to the exam format rather than relying solely on experience.</p>
                
                <p>The most time-intensive work this week was completing Section 5 through Video 108, which focuses on traditional and predictive project management methodologies. This section was significantly more detailed and process-heavy than earlier content. It required more focused attention, but it also validated my decision to prioritize full video completion before transitioning into note-taking and deep review. At this stage, understanding scope and structure is more important than documentation.</p>
                
                <p>A major milestone this week was officially scheduling and paying for the CAPM exam. The exam is scheduled for March 17, 2026, at 3:00 p.m., and will be taken remotely from home. Locking in the exam date changes the nature of this project in a meaningful way. What was previously a flexible study plan is now tied to a fixed deadline, which increases accountability and sharpens focus for the remaining weeks.</p>
                
                <p>This senior project is not about building a portfolio from scratch. I already maintain a professional portfolio at aprilsykes.dev, which reflects my prior academic work and professional background. The CAPM certification strengthens that existing portfolio by formally validating my project management knowledge and supporting my transition into associate or assistant project management roles.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, this week confirmed that the study plan is working as intended. Progress is steady, the workload remains manageable, and the project is firmly on schedule. With predictive methodologies largely complete and the exam date set, I am well positioned to move into Agile and hybrid approaches next, followed by structured review and practice exams.</p>

                <h2>Week 3 Journal Entry</h2>
                <h3>IS490 Blog – Week 3 Reflection</h3>
                <p class="date">January 31, 2026</p>
                
                <p>This week I continued working through the Udemy CAPM Exam Prep course, which makes up the core of my study plan for Weeks 2 through 4. My focus this week was on building familiarity with PMI concepts rather than diving deeply into details, since the detailed work is planned for later during practice exams and domain review.</p>
                
                <p>I completed Udemy Section 3: Project Management Principles, which introduced the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and the twelve project management principles outlined in the PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition. These principles emphasize areas such as stewardship, leadership, value delivery, risk, and adaptability. What stood out to me was how PMI frames these principles as guiding behaviors rather than rigid rules, which better reflects how projects actually operate in real environments.</p>
                
                <p>I also completed Udemy Section 4: Project Performance Domains, including the stakeholder and team performance domains. These sections helped reinforce PMI's shift away from a purely process driven model toward a results focused view of project management. The performance domain approach aligns well with my prior experience in IT, where outcomes and coordination often matter more than strictly following predefined steps.</p>
                
                <p>In addition, I began Udemy Section 5: Predictive Project Management, which is significantly more detailed and time intensive than earlier sections. This section introduces traditional project management concepts such as process groups and foundational predictive practices. By the end of this week, I will have completed approximately half of this section, keeping me on track within the three week Udemy timeline.</p>
                
                <p>I also officially scheduled and paid for the CAPM exam this week. The exam is scheduled for March 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM, to be taken online from home. Having the exam date set adds accountability and confirms that the project timeline is realistic.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, progress this week was steady and aligned with my plan. The focus remains on completing the Udemy content efficiently, with detailed review and reinforcement planned for the practice exam phase later in the project.</p>

                <h2>Week 2 Journal Entry</h2>
                <h3>Getting Into the Material</h3>
                <p class="date">January 17, 2026</p>
                
                <p>Week 2 is where my senior project actually started. Week 1 was all planning and setup. This week was about doing the work and seeing the CAPM material in its real form.</p>
                
                <p>I completed Sections 1 and 2 of the Udemy CAPM Exam Prep course, which totaled 32 videos. These sections covered the foundation of project management and how the CAPM exam is structured. The content included what defines a project, the difference between project, program, and portfolio management, and how operations differ from projects. It also covered how projects create value and enable organizational change.</p>
                
                <p>The course moved into project life cycles, governance, stakeholders, and organizational structures. It explained the role of the project manager, milestones, and the purpose of a PMO. The later videos introduced project constraints, project management approaches, emotional intelligence, and the difference between leadership and management.</p>
                
                <p>This phase of the project is intentionally instruction only. I am not doing practice exams or simulators yet. The first three weeks are reserved for Udemy content so I can absorb PMI terminology and perspective without jumping ahead to testing. That structure matters because PMI is very specific about how concepts are framed.</p>
                
                <p>From a process standpoint, the study plan is working. I stayed within the schedule and tracked my time. No changes were needed this week. The workload felt realistic and manageable.</p>
                
                <p>Week 2 confirms that the project is on track. The foundation is being built carefully and deliberately. Once the Udemy phase is complete, I will move into deeper domain work with practice and evaluation, but for now the focus is exactly where it should be.</p>

                <h2>Week 1 Journal Entry</h2>
                <h3>What I'm Actually Expecting from IS490</h3>
                <p class="date">January 6, 2026</p>
                
                <p>So here I am in IS490 with a pretty specific goal: get my CAPM certification in 7 weeks. Not the usual senior project approach, but I'm not really interested in building another app that'll sit on GitHub forever.</p>
                
                <p><strong>First expectation:</strong> I need this to actually work. I've got a tight timeline and honestly, limited resources. I can't afford to mess around with this certification. I spent this week building out a complete study system - 7 weeks mapped to the four CAPM domains, practice exams scheduled, Claude AI integrated for targeted help. It's either going to work or it's not, but at least I'll know I planned it right.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Second:</strong> I want to understand this stuff for real. The CAPM covers Project Management Fundamentals (36%), Predictive stuff (17%), Agile (20%), and Business Analysis (27%). I've worked in project support roles before, so I'm not starting from zero. But there's a difference between knowing how things work and being able to prove it on a PMI exam. I need both.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Third expectation:</strong> stuff's going to break. My study plan assumes I'll bomb early practice exams. That's fine. I've built in time to fix weak areas and target specific domains where I'm struggling. The goal isn't to be perfect from day one - it's to get better systematically.</p>
                
                <p>Career-wise, I'm expecting real impact. I already have a professional portfolio at aprilsykes.dev where I'm positioning myself for PM roles. Getting this certification changes my positioning from "interested in project management" to "CAPM-certified associate." That opens doors to assistant project manager roles where I can build the 3+ years of experience needed for eventual PMP certification.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> this class is accountability. Weekly reports, advisor check-ins, documented progress - all of it keeps me honest about whether I'm actually progressing toward certification or just going through motions.</p>
                
                <p>Seven weeks. One shot. Let's see what happens.</p>

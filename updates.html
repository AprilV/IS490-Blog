                <h2>What I'm Actually Expecting from IS490</h2>
                <h3>Week 1 Journal Entry</h3>
                <p class="date">January 6, 2026</p>
                
                <p>So here I am in IS490 with a pretty specific goal: get my CAPM certification in 7 weeks. Not the usual senior project approach, but I'm not really interested in building another app that'll sit on GitHub forever.</p>
                
                <p><strong>First expectation:</strong> I need this to actually work. I've got a tight timeline and honestly, limited resources. I can't afford to mess around with this certification. I spent this week building out a complete study system - 7 weeks mapped to the four CAPM domains, practice exams scheduled, Claude AI integrated for targeted help. It's either going to work or it's not, but at least I'll know I planned it right.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Second:</strong> I want to understand this stuff for real. The CAPM covers Project Management Fundamentals (36%), Predictive stuff (17%), Agile (20%), and Business Analysis (27%). I've worked in project support roles before, so I'm not starting from zero. But there's a difference between knowing how things work and being able to prove it on a PMI exam. I need both.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Third expectation:</strong> stuff's going to break. My study plan assumes I'll bomb early practice exams. That's fine. I've built in time to fix weak areas and target specific domains where I'm struggling. The goal isn't to be perfect from day one - it's to get better systematically.</p>
                
                <p>Career-wise, I'm expecting real impact. I already have a professional portfolio at aprilsykes.dev where I'm positioning myself for PM roles. Getting this certification changes my positioning from "interested in project management" to "CAPM-certified associate." That opens doors to assistant project manager roles where I can build the 3+ years of experience needed for eventual PMP certification.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> this class is accountability. Weekly reports, advisor check-ins, documented progress - all of it keeps me honest about whether I'm actually progressing toward certification or just going through motions.</p>
                
                <p>Seven weeks. One shot. Let's see what happens.</p>

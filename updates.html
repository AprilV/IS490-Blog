                <h2>Week 2 Journal Entry</h2>
                <h3>Getting Into the Material</h3>
                <p class="date">January 17, 2026</p>
                
                <p>Week 2 is where my senior project actually started. Week 1 was all planning and setup. This week was about doing the work and seeing the CAPM material in its real form.</p>
                
                <p>I completed Sections 1 and 2 of the Udemy CAPM Exam Prep course, which totaled 32 videos. These sections covered the foundation of project management and how the CAPM exam is structured. The content included what defines a project, the difference between project, program, and portfolio management, and how operations differ from projects. It also covered how projects create value and enable organizational change.</p>
                
                <p>The course moved into project life cycles, governance, stakeholders, and organizational structures. It explained the role of the project manager, milestones, and the purpose of a PMO. The later videos introduced project constraints, project management approaches, emotional intelligence, and the difference between leadership and management.</p>
                
                <p>This phase of the project is intentionally instruction only. I am not doing practice exams or simulators yet. The first three weeks are reserved for Udemy content so I can absorb PMI terminology and perspective without jumping ahead to testing. That structure matters because PMI is very specific about how concepts are framed.</p>
                
                <p>From a process standpoint, the study plan is working. I stayed within the schedule and tracked my time. No changes were needed this week. The workload felt realistic and manageable.</p>
                
                <p>Week 2 confirms that the project is on track. The foundation is being built carefully and deliberately. Once the Udemy phase is complete, I will move into deeper domain work with practice and evaluation, but for now the focus is exactly where it should be.</p>

                <h2>Week 1 Journal Entry</h2>
                <h3>What I'm Actually Expecting from IS490</h3>
                <p class="date">January 6, 2026</p>
                
                <p>So here I am in IS490 with a pretty specific goal: get my CAPM certification in 7 weeks. Not the usual senior project approach, but I'm not really interested in building another app that'll sit on GitHub forever.</p>
                
                <p><strong>First expectation:</strong> I need this to actually work. I've got a tight timeline and honestly, limited resources. I can't afford to mess around with this certification. I spent this week building out a complete study system - 7 weeks mapped to the four CAPM domains, practice exams scheduled, Claude AI integrated for targeted help. It's either going to work or it's not, but at least I'll know I planned it right.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Second:</strong> I want to understand this stuff for real. The CAPM covers Project Management Fundamentals (36%), Predictive stuff (17%), Agile (20%), and Business Analysis (27%). I've worked in project support roles before, so I'm not starting from zero. But there's a difference between knowing how things work and being able to prove it on a PMI exam. I need both.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Third expectation:</strong> stuff's going to break. My study plan assumes I'll bomb early practice exams. That's fine. I've built in time to fix weak areas and target specific domains where I'm struggling. The goal isn't to be perfect from day one - it's to get better systematically.</p>
                
                <p>Career-wise, I'm expecting real impact. I already have a professional portfolio at aprilsykes.dev where I'm positioning myself for PM roles. Getting this certification changes my positioning from "interested in project management" to "CAPM-certified associate." That opens doors to assistant project manager roles where I can build the 3+ years of experience needed for eventual PMP certification.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> this class is accountability. Weekly reports, advisor check-ins, documented progress - all of it keeps me honest about whether I'm actually progressing toward certification or just going through motions.</p>
                
                <p>Seven weeks. One shot. Let's see what happens.</p>

                <h2>CAPM Progress Update</h2>
                <h3>Week 5 Journal Entry</h3>
                <p class="date">February 5, 2026</p>
                
                <p>This week marked a shift from simply moving through Udemy content to actively working with more complex predictive project management concepts. I progressed through Udemy Section 5 from Video 108 through Video 134, completing Videos 109–133. These videos covered the transition from planning into executing and monitoring and controlling, along with the introduction to earned value management.</p>
                
                <p>A significant portion of my time this week was spent practicing rather than just watching videos. I worked extensively with the Critical Path Method, focusing on both forward pass and backward pass calculations to better understand schedule logic instead of relying on memorization. I also began working through earned value management concepts and formulas, paying attention to what each metric represents and how it is used to evaluate project performance.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to the initial video instruction, I rewatched key sections, completed a quiz related to predictive project management topics, and spent several hours working through CPM and EVM exercises. I also purchased the PMBOK® Guide Sixth Edition as a supplemental reference and spent time reviewing sections relevant to predictive methodologies to reinforce what I am learning in the course.</p>
                
                <p>I met with my faculty advisor, Mr. Becker, to discuss workload and CAPM exam timing. Given the amount of practice required for scheduling and cost topics, we confirmed that there is flexibility to delay the exam if needed. This reduced pressure and allows me to focus on understanding the material thoroughly rather than rushing through it.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, Week 5 involved steady progress through the most demanding part of the Udemy course. The focus has shifted toward deeper comprehension and applied practice, particularly in critical path analysis and earned value management, which are essential for both the exam and real-world project management work.</p>

                <h2>From Coursework to Commitment</h2>
                <h3>Week 4 Journal Entry</h3>
                <p class="date">January 29, 2026</p>
                
                <p>This week built directly on the foundation established in prior weeks and marked deeper progress into predictive, plan-based project management. Having already completed the PMI principles and performance domains, my focus shifted almost entirely to advancing through the more detailed and structured content in Udemy Section 5.</p>
                
                <p>I continued working through Section 5 and completed the material through Video 108. This portion of the course is noticeably more dense and process-oriented than earlier sections, requiring sustained attention and slower pacing. Concepts introduced earlier at a high level are now being applied in more concrete ways, reinforcing how PMI expects candidates to understand predictive methodologies in practice rather than in theory.</p>
                
                <p>At this stage, my approach remains intentionally video-first. Rather than stopping to document every concept, the goal is to gain full exposure to the scope and structure of the predictive framework. This allows me to clearly identify where deeper review will be required later during practice exams and domain-specific reinforcement. The increased complexity of this section confirms that this sequencing decision was appropriate.</p>
                
                <p>With the CAPM exam now formally scheduled, this week also represented a shift in mindset. The project is no longer operating against a flexible timeline; progress is now measured against a fixed exam date. That has reinforced the importance of maintaining consistency and avoiding unnecessary rework while completing the remaining Udemy content.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, progress this week remained steady and aligned with the study plan. Section 5 is nearing completion, and the project continues to move forward on schedule. The next phase will involve transitioning into Agile and hybrid methodologies, followed by structured review and practice testing.</p>

                <h2>Week 3 Journal Entry</h2>
                <h3>IS490 Blog – Week 3 Reflection</h3>
                <p class="date">January 31, 2026</p>
                
                <p>This week I continued working through the Udemy CAPM Exam Prep course, which makes up the core of my study plan for Weeks 2 through 4. My focus this week was on building familiarity with PMI concepts rather than diving deeply into details, since the detailed work is planned for later during practice exams and domain review.</p>
                
                <p>I completed Udemy Section 3: Project Management Principles, which introduced the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and the twelve project management principles outlined in the PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition. These principles emphasize areas such as stewardship, leadership, value delivery, risk, and adaptability. What stood out to me was how PMI frames these principles as guiding behaviors rather than rigid rules, which better reflects how projects actually operate in real environments.</p>
                
                <p>I also completed Udemy Section 4: Project Performance Domains, including the stakeholder and team performance domains. These sections helped reinforce PMI's shift away from a purely process driven model toward a results focused view of project management. The performance domain approach aligns well with my prior experience in IT, where outcomes and coordination often matter more than strictly following predefined steps.</p>
                
                <p>In addition, I began Udemy Section 5: Predictive Project Management, which is significantly more detailed and time intensive than earlier sections. This section introduces traditional project management concepts such as process groups and foundational predictive practices. By the end of this week, I will have completed approximately half of this section, keeping me on track within the three week Udemy timeline.</p>
                
                <p>I also officially scheduled and paid for the CAPM exam this week. The exam is scheduled for March 17, 2026 at 3:00 PM, to be taken online from home. Having the exam date set adds accountability and confirms that the project timeline is realistic.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, progress this week was steady and aligned with my plan. The focus remains on completing the Udemy content efficiently, with detailed review and reinforcement planned for the practice exam phase later in the project.</p>

                <h2>Week 2 Journal Entry</h2>
                <h3>Getting Into the Material</h3>
                <p class="date">January 17, 2026</p>
                
                <p>Week 2 is where my senior project actually started. Week 1 was all planning and setup. This week was about doing the work and seeing the CAPM material in its real form.</p>
                
                <p>I completed Sections 1 and 2 of the Udemy CAPM Exam Prep course, which totaled 32 videos. These sections covered the foundation of project management and how the CAPM exam is structured. The content included what defines a project, the difference between project, program, and portfolio management, and how operations differ from projects. It also covered how projects create value and enable organizational change.</p>
                
                <p>The course moved into project life cycles, governance, stakeholders, and organizational structures. It explained the role of the project manager, milestones, and the purpose of a PMO. The later videos introduced project constraints, project management approaches, emotional intelligence, and the difference between leadership and management.</p>
                
                <p>This phase of the project is intentionally instruction only. I am not doing practice exams or simulators yet. The first three weeks are reserved for Udemy content so I can absorb PMI terminology and perspective without jumping ahead to testing. That structure matters because PMI is very specific about how concepts are framed.</p>
                
                <p>From a process standpoint, the study plan is working. I stayed within the schedule and tracked my time. No changes were needed this week. The workload felt realistic and manageable.</p>
                
                <p>Week 2 confirms that the project is on track. The foundation is being built carefully and deliberately. Once the Udemy phase is complete, I will move into deeper domain work with practice and evaluation, but for now the focus is exactly where it should be.</p>

                <h2>Week 1 Journal Entry</h2>
                <h3>What I'm Actually Expecting from IS490</h3>
                <p class="date">January 6, 2026</p>
                
                <p>So here I am in IS490 with a pretty specific goal: get my CAPM certification in 7 weeks. Not the usual senior project approach, but I'm not really interested in building another app that'll sit on GitHub forever.</p>
                
                <p><strong>First expectation:</strong> I need this to actually work. I've got a tight timeline and honestly, limited resources. I can't afford to mess around with this certification. I spent this week building out a complete study system - 7 weeks mapped to the four CAPM domains, practice exams scheduled, Claude AI integrated for targeted help. It's either going to work or it's not, but at least I'll know I planned it right.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Second:</strong> I want to understand this stuff for real. The CAPM covers Project Management Fundamentals (36%), Predictive stuff (17%), Agile (20%), and Business Analysis (27%). I've worked in project support roles before, so I'm not starting from zero. But there's a difference between knowing how things work and being able to prove it on a PMI exam. I need both.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Third expectation:</strong> stuff's going to break. My study plan assumes I'll bomb early practice exams. That's fine. I've built in time to fix weak areas and target specific domains where I'm struggling. The goal isn't to be perfect from day one - it's to get better systematically.</p>
                
                <p>Career-wise, I'm expecting real impact. I already have a professional portfolio at aprilsykes.dev where I'm positioning myself for PM roles. Getting this certification changes my positioning from "interested in project management" to "CAPM-certified associate." That opens doors to assistant project manager roles where I can build the 3+ years of experience needed for eventual PMP certification.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> this class is accountability. Weekly reports, advisor check-ins, documented progress - all of it keeps me honest about whether I'm actually progressing toward certification or just going through motions.</p>
                
                <p>Seven weeks. One shot. Let's see what happens.</p>
